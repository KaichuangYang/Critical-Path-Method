# Critical-Path-Method
The critical path method (CPM) is a technique where you identify tasks that are necessary for project completion and determine scheduling flexibilities.'
'A critical path in project management is the longest sequence of activities that must be finished on time in order for the entire project to be complete.' 
'Any delays in critical tasks will delay the rest of the project.'
'You can play with the algorithm by running main_CPM.py'

* By running this program, you will get your network's properties, including EET, LET, ET, and Critical Path

* If you already have a network matrix, you can input a matrix or a list

* If you do not have one, don't worry, just input a natrual number,we will generate a random project for you
